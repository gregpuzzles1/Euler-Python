# Euler-Python

This repository contains my solutions to several problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require more than just mathematical knowledge to solve. Many of these problems are best solved with computer programs, making this a popular platform for those wanting to improve their programming and problem-solving skills.

You can learn more or try the problems yourself by visiting the [Project Euler website](https://projecteuler.net/).

## About This Repository

- The scripts in this repository are my solutions to a number of Project Euler problems.
- The scripts are written in Python.
- These solutions need to be refactored to ensure compatibility with Python 3.11 or greater.
- Each script may contain a brief description or problem statement at the top.

## Contributing
